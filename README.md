# Term-I, kuteshi's terminal emulator.

This is very beta and not finished in any way. This is a quick release to make this<br>
opensource faster and I can learn git faster.

# How the heck do I use this?
1. Click the "Download" button and get the zip.
2. Unpack it and open it
3. Install Node and npm
4. Now, launch a command prompt and `cd` to the place you unpacked the zip!
5. Now run (cmd) `npm install` to install a dependency!
5. Now run (cmd) `npm start`! It'll start a simple http server!
6. Then go to one of the links the command gives you!
7. ???
8. Profit?
